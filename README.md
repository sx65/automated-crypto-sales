## Configuration

You can modify the following variables in the code to customize the bot:

- `product_price` - Base price of the product in USDT
- `tracking_fee` - Small fee added to make each transaction amount unique
- `cooldown_time` - Time users must wait between purchases (in milliseconds)

## Database

The bot uses SQLite to store:

- Transactions
- Audit logs
- User cooldowns
- Used payment amounts

## How It Works

1. User initiates purchase with `/purchase` command
2. Bot generates a unique transaction ID and payment amount
3. User receives payment instructions with QR code
4. Bot monitors the blockchain for incoming payments
5. Upon payment detection, a product key is generated and sent to the user
6. User receives the "Product Owner" role in the server

## Transaction Lifecycle

- **Pending**: Payment requested but not yet received
- **Completed**: Payment received and product key delivered
- **Expired**: 30-minute payment window elapsed with no payment
- **Cancelled**: Transaction cancelled by an administrator
